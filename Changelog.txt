	-Added the initial code for the start menu. 
	-Player presses "P" to get the menu to appear. Need to figure out how to keep the menu on the screen instead of toggling on and off with the key press. 
	-Also, the menu is moving up and to the left so you can see the whole thing until I resize it for the game.
