Our story begins, as many do, with an unlikely protagonist. 
A college student named Mason, who’s just woken up without 
his alarm, rushing out the door to his first class.
-
The roads are empty, what with the rush to classes paused for now. 
Strange... Who are those shady figures over by the forest? 
Bandits of some kind!? 
-
On a college campus? Our protagonist is curious, more importantly 
he is concerned. From over here, just happening to avoid their sight,
he could tell that these men were dangerous.
-
Mason searched the area. It seems a cosplayer has left their gear 
nearby! A stroke of luck. Our protagonist arms himself with the 
surprisingly real gear. Perhaps he could defend himself...
~
//START COMBAT: Enemy 1, LINE 22
~
"Hey, boys, we've been spotted!" the first bandit shouts, moving to
engage immediately. Seems it was prudent to use the equipment, 
he draws a knife and lunges!
~
//END COMBAT: Enemy 1, LINE 28
~
The bandit falls defeated. The other two are coming toward the path, 
but our protagonist moves to meet them head on. They attacked him
for no reason, Mason knew he had to protect the other students! 
~
//START COMBAT: Enemy 2, LINE 34
~
The second bandit approaches the path, hefting a club. "How'd a
fighter get here? I ain't going back underground, hear me? It's all dark
and horrible down there!" He shouts, charging our protagonist.
~
//END COMBAT: ENEMY 2, LINE 40 
~
The second bandit finally falls. What "underground" did he try 
to escape from? A jail perhaps? Really, where had any of these 
bandits come from? Their accent was very strange...
~
//START COMBAT: ENEMY 3, LINE 46
~
Our protagonist reaches the last bandit that seems to be around.
He's a lanky man, clad in a black cloak. He draws two jagged blades,
whirling them around threateningly.
-
"Unfortunate you've killed those two. Good fighters. But it doesn’t 
matter. I’m out of there, and I’m never going back." Out of where? 
His blades flash in Mason's direction. Our protagonist engages!
~
//END COMBAT: Enemy 3, LINE 56
~
Finally, the duel wielder falls. Mason is exhausted, but victorious.
Now he just had to find where the bandits had even come from...

~
//END LEVEL: 1, LINE  62
~
If there was anything that could have brought them from a strange
land, it was this... A strange glittering, warping space floated in 
the air. What if our protagonist were to touch it...?
-
A flood of dead leaves fills Mason's vision! There is a sensation of 
falling along with them for at least a minute straight. Suddenly, he 
lands in a soft leaf pile. Our protagonist pulls himself up...
~
//START LEVEL: 2/TUNNELS, LINE 72
~
He finds himself in an underground tunnel of some kind! The thing
was colossal! Could this be the tunnel below the quarter mile, Mason 
thought? No, it was a titanic cavernous place. "The underground."
-
Shuffling feet and drawn blades echo through the tunnel. More 
bandits, confirming our protagonist's conclusion. Looking around, 
our protagonist finds a dead end with no portal. Forward it is... 
~
//START COMBAT: Enemy 4, LINE 82
~
"How have we been found?" The bandit mutters, brandishing a knife.
He looks far more competant than the first bandit who'd used one. 
"Doesn’t matter. This passage to the palace is our secret alone..."
~
//END COMBAT: Enemy 4, LINE 88
~
Palace? Where did that portal take me? Our protagonist wonders. 
Still no way out in sight. He had to press on if he were to find his
way home. And possibly take care of more bandits...
~
//START COMBAT: ENEMY 5, LINE 92
~
"No way buddy! The only ones getting out of this hole are me and 
my gang! You’ll never reach that portal!" A scrappy looking bandit 
shouts, drawing a longsword as he charges from the darkness!
~
//END COMBAT: ENEMY 5, LINE 100
~
It seems the bandits are looking for a way out as well. Perhaps you 
can find the palace by following their path. It seems Mason made a
better adventurer, or protagonist as it were, than he expected!
~
//START COMBAT: ENEMY 6, LINE 106
~
A huge bandit, armored unimpressively in worn leather, stands 
between our protagonist and his path. He twirls a knife in one hand,
gripping another. "Curiosity? You killed the cats, so..." He says.
-
"I don't see why they think it's so bad down here. Plenty nicer parts
where folks got good lives. But I got hired, and I do my jobs."
The huge bandit snatches his twirling dagger. He stalks forward...
-
Our protagonist attacks first, but the assassin dodges, unnaturally 
fast for his size. Something glints in his black eyes, something 
unsettling. Mason flinches. The bandit grins and strikes again...
~
//END COMBAT: ENEMY 6, LINE 120
~
The huge bandit falls. Our protagonist is exhausted and disturbed, 
but he had finally outfought the huge assassin with the twisted smile. 
The tunnel ahead has a small door at the end. The secret passage!

//NOTE: NO ENTRANCE NOR EXIT FOR THE TUNNEL
//START LEVEL: 4/PALACE, LINE 128
~
The palace, finally! Our protagonist wanted to run and find his way
home, but someone blocked the way. A tall, shadowy man, dressed 
to kill, quite literally considering the ornate rapier he held.
-
"My scout said that you’d defeated the bandits." He says. "I thank 
you for that. But I’m afraid that I can’t let you go further. This 
gate leads to the portal, and if you return above..."  
-
"The people I rule over are happy, but if this portal is opened, our 
worlds will collide. What then? Your people invade? Usurp me, and 
ravage my lands, my people? No." Mason hadn't thought of it...
-
"So I, Baron Methias, will end you myself. For my sake, and for my 
people’s sake." He finishes. Our protagonist sees only this man's 
pride. He was wrong. The above ground wouldn't do such a thing.
-
Our protagonist raised his weapon, and the baron did the same. 
As he leveled his rapier, Mason couldn't see pride, nor greed.
Methias stood firm, guarding the gate. He had something to defend.
-
How shall this story end...?


~
//NOTE: NO BEFORE COMBAT.
//END TEXT: PROTAG WIN, LINE 155
~
Our protagonist is finally victorious, and returns home. There, he
tells the world of what he'd found. First scientists come to the portal,
then reporters, then explorers. And then came the opportunists.
-
Everything the world had to give it gave, the people Methias had
once protected oppressed, and the land abused. Eventually outcry
motivated diplomatic efforts, and the two lands might find peace.
~
//END TEXT: ANTAG WIN, LINE 165
~
Our protagonist finally falls, lost to the underground. His portal 
home sealed away again for generations to come. Methias returns 
to his throne, and reigns long and happy.
-
His people are defended, his lands rich, and some say these years
are the golden age of the underground. In the forest, the distortion 
winks out of existence, the underground propsering in secret.
